# Calculator

Based on the "Calculator" project from The Odin School's curriculum (https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/calculator)

One of the first projects I have built from scratch. I learned a lot about array and string methods as well as 
general Javascript functionality. 

I am pretty happy with how it works for the most part, but if I had to make it again, I would try to plan out
how I would implement all of the functionality, rather than piecing it on as I went.
